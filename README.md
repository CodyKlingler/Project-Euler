# Project-Euler
This repository tracks my progress of <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about">ProjectEuler's</a> first 100 <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">problems</a>.
I started solving these because I'm interested in math and algorithms.

I'm still not sure of the best way to organize the solutions to 100 unique problems. Currently I have each problem stored as a function in solutions.cpp.
